Prior to that, at the National Center for Biological Sciences, I applied sequence alignment algorithms for small molecule structure comparison and developed a stochastic model of Transcription. At the Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, the focus was to reconstruct microbial metabolic pathways from publicly available databases and analyze the network topology.\nAway from work, I enjoy bicyling, running and reading.

The fungus is cultured in Bioreactor and Rotary shaker at varying pH for extraction of crude metabolite. The crude metabolite produced by the fungus is then tested for herbicidal and anti-fungal activity. Parthenium hyterophorus and Neurospora species were chosen to study herbicidal and anti-fungal activity respectively. This present preliminary investigation revealed significant herbicidal activity and anti-fungal activity as observed by wilting of Parthenium plant and inhibition of Neurospora colonies on agar plate by Drechslera metabolites. Best results were obtained by growing Drechslera puttaparthii sp.nov at pH 5.4 on Czapex-dox medium.
