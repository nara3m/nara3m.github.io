The fungus is cultured in Bioreactor and Rotary shaker at varying pH for extraction of crude metabolite. The crude metabolite produced by the fungus is then tested for herbicidal and anti-fungal activity. Parthenium hyterophorus and Neurospora species were chosen to study herbicidal and anti-fungal activity respectively. This present preliminary investigation revealed significant herbicidal activity and anti-fungal activity as observed by wilting of Parthenium plant and inhibition of Neurospora colonies on agar plate by Drechslera metabolites. Best results were obtained by growing Drechslera puttaparthii sp.nov at pH 5.4 on Czapex-dox medium. Further work to isolate the compounds responsible for herbicidal and anti-fungal activity is in progress","tags":["Antimicrobial activity","Herbicides","Microbiology"],"title":"Studies on cellulose degradation by Drechslera puttaparthii by semi-solid fermentation technique","type":"publication"}]
